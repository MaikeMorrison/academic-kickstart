## Graduate School Application Guide

With the intention of helping younger students in the Dean's Scholars Honors Program who were hoping to apply to graduate school after finishing their undergraduate degrees, my friend [Griffin](http://griffindglenn.github.io/) and I wrote a [**guide to graduate school applications!**](files/resource-grad_app_guide.pdf) It contains:

* A summary of the application 

We wrote this document with the aim of sharing what we wish we knew before we began the application process. We hope it serves you well!

I also recommend Dr. Collins' book [*The Language of God*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_of_God) and the Biologos [podcast](https://biologos.org/podcast/language-of-god) by the same name.

* [The Emerging Scholars Network](https://blog.emergingscholars.org/about/): The ESN is
