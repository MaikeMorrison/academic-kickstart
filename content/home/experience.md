  Under Dr. Mark Kirkpatrick, I evaluated the performance of Bayesian phylogenetics and Phylogeography (an MCMC program for analyzing DNA alignments under the multispecies coalescent model) when applied to prokaryotic genomic data. 

  I used this tool to identify independently evolving lineages, or ecotypes, within a superabundant marine cyanobacteria responsible for 5% of global oxygen production, *Prochlorococcus marinus*.

  With the guidance Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers and Dr. Lauren Castro, I analyzed the Texas counties and school districts most at risk of an outbreak due to high conscientious vaccination exemption rates and fit an array of models to identify sociodemographic predictors of these exemptions.

  As part of the [UCSF Summer Research Training Program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/srtp) and the [Amgen Scholars Program](https://amgenscholars.com/), I worked with Dr. John Witte, Dr. Linda Kachuri, and Dr. Sara Rashkin to conduct genome-wide association studies of immune response strength to 22 distinct antigens.

  We identified many interesting and novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are implicated in immune response variability.

  This work is part of a manuscript, "The landscape of host genetic factors involved in infection to common viruses and SARS-CoV-2" which is currently a pre-print on medRxiv. [Link here!](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088054)

  As part of The Mathematical Biosciences Institute NSF REU Program, I worked with Dr. Ephraim Hanks and Emily Strong to explore the dynamics of disease spread over patchy terrain through an extensive simulation study.
  
  We found that terrain heterogeneity (i.e. resource selection) can cause population dispersal to be heavy tailed, creating accelerating epidemic waves.
